## Karlsruhe B2run 2024 explanatory data analysis

## Requirements
* Make sure you have already downloaded (in the root project directory) a chrome webdriver that matches with the version of the Chrome browser installed on your machine. Chrome driver releases are available at [here](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/). The version of my browser at the time of writing was `125.0.6422.141 (64 bit)`.

## Usage
You can use `b2run.ipynb` as a template. The notebook is self-contained and you can run further analysis for different teams. To get the results of the competition in 2024, I used Python selenium for web scraping. You can find the link to the results in the Jupyter notebook. You can also find more infromation about the competition [here](https://www.b2run.de/run/de/de/karlsruhe/news/2024/news-ka-setup.html).
